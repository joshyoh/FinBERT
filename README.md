# Stock Price Prediction with FinBERT model
This is a short project that demonstrates the process I used to try and predict stock price with sentiment analysis using the FinBERT model. My goal was to create data gathered from text in 10Q documents that correlated to IBM's historical stock price.

This project is possible due to the "transformers' library created by hugging face. Many pre-trained models are avaliable for public use, including the FinBERT model. You can learn more about them on their website: https://huggingface.co/

The initial notebook is Sentimen_Modeling.ipynb, followed by Restructure_and_Analyze_Data.ipynb
